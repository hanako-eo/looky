# Looky

An experimental port of [scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy) for Rust.

Looky is a tool like scapy for manipulating binary packages.
Looky will provide a way to encode and decode packages and describe them using the Rust. In addition, it will provide a way of manipulating them more easily (and also a maintainable, lightweight way of doing so).
